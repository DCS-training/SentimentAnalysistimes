    "**VADER** stands for Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning. This sentiment analyzer can estimate positivity, neutrality, and negativity, which is called **polarity**, and it can estimate the intensity of these sentiments. VADER estimates the sentiment of a text by computing how much positivity, neutrality, and negativity there is in the text, and then normalizes those computed scores to get a compound score.\n",
